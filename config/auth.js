// Authentication Middleware: This middleware checks if a user is authenticated or logged in before allowing access to certain routes. It can verify the user's session, token, or credentials.

// Authorization Middleware: This middleware checks if a user has the necessary permissions to access certain resources or perform specific actions. It can validate the user's role, privileges, or ownership of the resource.

// Error Handling Middleware: This middleware handles any errors that occur during the request-response cycle. It can catch and format errors, log them, and send an appropriate error response to the client.

// Request Logging Middleware: This middleware logs information about incoming requests, such as the request method, URL, timestamp, and user agent. It can be useful for debugging and auditing purposes.

// Validation Middleware: This middleware validates the incoming request data, such as form inputs or API payloads. It ensures that the data meets certain criteria or follows specific rules before further processing.


// Make sure to place your middleware functions in the appropriate order to achieve the desired behavior.
